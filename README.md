## Objectives 
Cyclistic is a bike-share company based in Chicago with two key customer segments: casual riders renting single-ride or full-day passes, and annual members that purchase yearly plans. Financial analysts have concluded that focusing on a higher conversion rate of casual riders to annual members will maximize profits. 

The marketing analytics team wants to understand **how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.** From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Metrics 
- **Customer Type:** Casual Rider or Annual Member
- **Sales:** Total Bike Rides rented from both casual riders and annual members
- **Ride Length:** Average Length of Ride in minutes

## Dimensions
- **Seasonality:** Trends by Month
- **Day of Week:** Trends by Day of Week
- **Time of Day:** Trends by Time of Day
- **Bike Type:** Classic or Electric
  
## Summary of Findings
### Seasonality: 
- Starting in July 2023, sales were at an all-time high peaking at 771,693 total rides in August 2023. Heading into Fall 2023 and Winter 2024, sales dropped significantly with a low of 144,854 rides in January 2024 (~81% dip in total sales).
- On average, casual riders bike 14 minutes longer than annual members, and the durations trend up and down in relation to season. Annual members remain consistent at just under 13 minutes of average ride time throughout the year. 
- Warmers seasons indicate an increase in demand for both customer types - investigate to confirm key months leading into Spring & Summer to launch ad campaigns and promotions.

### Day of Week: 
- Annual members have higher sales mid-week (Monday - Friday), while casual riders peak on weekends (Saturday & Sunday), suggesting different use cases for both customer types throughout the week (commuting, convenience, leisure, exercise).

### Time of Day: 
- Annual member sales peak at two different points in a single day - once at 8:00 AM and again at 5:00 PM. In contrast, casual riders only increase their volume towards late afternoon / evening.
- There is a possible opportunity to launch several informative ad campaigns targeted to increasing awareness in casual riders on the benefits of using Cyclistic for their morning commutes.

### Bike Type:
- Based on total sales, casual riders prefer electric bikes slightly more, whereas annual members prefer classic bikes. 
- While average ride lengths are relatively equal for both customer segments in electric bikes, casual riders rent classic bikes for more than twice the length of time that annual members do.

## Recommendations / Next Steps
- Additional analysis is required to highlight the different use cases for bike rentals between annual members and casual riders under different. Create a marketing plan targeted to encouraging
